--------------------------------------------Functionality-----------------------------------------------

-----Adding an item to the list----

To add an item to the list, enter "A" at the main menu prompt. The program will prompt you to enter an item to the list. Once you have entered an item, it will be added to the list.

-------Displaying current list items-------

To display the current list items, enter "L" at the main menu prompt. The program will display all the current items on the list.

-------Removing an item from the list-------

To remove an item from the list, enter "D" at the main menu prompt. The program will prompt you to enter the index of the item you want to remove. Once you have entered the index, the program will ask you to confirm the removal. If confirmed, the item will be removed from the list.

-------Clearing the entire list-------

To clear the entire list, enter "D -A" at the main menu prompt. The program will prompt you to confirm your decision. If confirmed, the entire list will be cleared.

------- Exiting the program ------- 

To exit the program, enter "E" at the main menu prompt. The program will prompt you to confirm your decision. If confirmed, the program will exit.


------- Notes------- 

- The program uses a while loop to keep the user in the main menu until they choose to exit.
- The program handles errors gracefully by prompting the user to enter valid input.
- The program displays appropriate messages to guide the user through each step.
